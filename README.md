# Max FPS/Client Modpack
### **NOTE: I recommend you download [Tex Fix 1.8.9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/texfix/files/25401560), [Optifine 1.8.9](https://optifine.net/downloads) and [Crash Patch](https://modrinth.com/mod/crashpatch/version/v2.0.0) and read the description lightly.**

Are you finding a modpack for 1.8.9 with all the **best performance mods?** Well here it is. Unlike the other 1.8.9 Modpacks this Modpack actually has more than 4 or 5 mods for performance. It has **10 FPS MODS**, 11 if you add **[Tex Fix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/texfix/files/25401560)** and **12 if you add [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads)!** And you may be thinking "its just a bigger number it doesnt mean more fps" **WELL YES IT DOES GIVE YOU MORE FPS** more info below.

<summary>Info About Performance/FPS</summary>
This Modpack is a pack that I have spent lots of time finding, configuring and installing mods for the maximum fps possible. After a few weeks I found all the mods possible that exist which are client side and give fps. Feel free to join the [issue discord](https://discord.gg/qjdtAM9dtp) if you have any mod suggestions.

Fps= Vanilla = 50 FPS Forge Optifine = 50 FPS Max Fps = 51 FPS

![Fps Check 1](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IwIZ8G9q/images/5ceda7cd636e3b173ee240b968fcbf6110217ef6.png)

There is almost no difference since my laptop is bad. But if we go somewhere which gives me a lot of fps you will see a difference. Fps= Vanilla = 90 FPS Forge Optifine = 93 FPS Max Fps = 103 FPS

![Fps Check 2](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IwIZ8G9q/images/cbf8a89ced0a08ec88a7a488f998f6a87cca58a2.png)

As you can see the fps has increased. So its really about your system. My system is below.

Specifications = Cpu = [Intel i5-5200U](https://cpu-benchmark.org/cpu/intel-core-i5-5200u/) Gpu = [Old AMD Radeon R7 M260 Series](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/AMD-R7-260X/Rating/3151) Gpu 2 = [Old Intel(R) HD Graphics 5500](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/16570/IntelR-HD-Graphics-5500) Ram = [Hynix ddr3 4GB](https://ram.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/203684/Hynix-DDR3-1600-4GB-135-1x4GB) All Specs: [CPU-Z Validation](https://valid.x86.fr/qu6xwz)

NOTE: Not all systems may improve with this modpack. High-end systems will improve a lot but low-end systems will only improve a lot in some scenarios. I recommend you download **[Optifine 1.8.9](https://optifine.net/downloads)** and **[Tex Fix 1.8.9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/texfix/files/25401560)**.

<summary>Q&A</summary>
<details>
<summary>Where's the Essential mod gui?</summary>

If you haven't noticed there isn't the Essential Mod GUI.  
This is because of Not So Essential.  
So if you want the Essential GUI back disable Not So Essential. 




</details>
<details>
<summary>Will Max Fps/Client be in legacy fabric?</summary>

Only if a forge and fabric mod allows to run both at the same time. Most FPS mods are in forge.
Don't contact me just to ask or beg.

<details>
<summary>My game is crashing</summary>
First check that you can play 1.8.9 by launching it in vanilla.
If it only happens in this modpack don't click the minimise button and keep your mouse on the tab.
If still doesn't work try searching for some vids on youtube for help it might be because you have a pc too bad to run this modpack.
